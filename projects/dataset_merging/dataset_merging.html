        1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

        2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

        3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

        4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

                        Fine-grained nucleus classification is challenging because of the high inter-class similarity and intra-class variability. Therefore, a large number of labeled data is required for training effective nucleus classification models. However, it is challenging to label a large-scale nucleus classification dataset comparable to ImageNet in natural images, considering that high-quality nucleus labeling requires specific domain knowledge. In addition, the existing publicly available datasets are often inconsistently labeled with divergent labeling criteria. Due to this inconsistency, conventional models have to be trained on each dataset separately and work independently to infer their own classification results, limiting their classification performance. To fully utilize all annotated datasets, we formulate the nucleus classification task as a multi-label problem with missing labels to utilize all datasets in a unified framework. Specifically, we merge all datasets and combine their labels as multiple labels. Thus, each data has one ground-truth label and several missing labels. We devise a base classification module which is trained using all data but sparsely supervised by the ground-truth labels only. We then exploit the correlation among different label sets by a label correlation module. By doing so, we can have two trained basic modules and further cross-train them with both ground-truth labels and pseudo labels for the missing ones. Importantly, data without any ground-truth labels can also be involved in our framework, as we can regard them as data with all labels missing and generate the corresponding pseudo labels. We carefully re-organized multiple publicly available nucleus classification datasets, converted them into a uniform format, and tested the proposed framework on them. Experimental results show substantial improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</td>

We first train the base classification module and label correlation module individually with ground truth labels yi,1 with cross entropy cosses L0 and L1 (Step A and B). We then cross-train the two modules with both the ground truth labels yi,1 and the mutually completed pseudo-labels(Step C).
